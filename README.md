# More Suits v1.4.1
### Adds more suits to choose from, and can be used as a library to load your own suits!

## Instructions
Place the ```x753-More_Suits-X.X.X``` folder in your ```BepInEx/Plugins``` folder. Make sure the ```moresuits``` folder is in the same folder as ```MoreSuits.dll```.

## Config File
After launching the game with the mod once, a config file is generated. In this file you can disable individual suits from being loaded, as well as ignore any ```!less-suits.txt``` file and attempt to load all suits (which is useful if you have another mod that helps manage lots of suits).

## Customize
You can add .png files to the ```moresuits``` folder to add new suits as long as both the host and clients have the same files.

## Advanced
You can add a .json file in the ```advanced``` folder with the same name as your .png file in the ```moresuits``` folder to enable additional features like emission. Place additional texture maps in the ```advanced``` folder.

For a list of supported features, see:
https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@14.0/manual/Lit-Shader.html

## Add Suits to Store
Add a "PRICE" key to your advanced .json to put a suit in the store rotation. See ```Glow.json``` for an example of adding a suit with emission that must be purchased from the store.

## Making your own More Suits mod
Upload your own package with a ```BepInEx/plugins/moresuits``` folder in it (do not include the MoreSuits.dll file) and add ```x753-More_Suits-1.4.0``` as a dependency, and this mod will automatically load your .png files as suits. If you don't want some or all of the suits that originally come with my mod, adjust the config file ```BepInEx\config\x753.More_Suits.cfg```. Include a ```!less-suits.txt``` file in your ```moresuits``` folder to disable all the default suits that come with this mod.
